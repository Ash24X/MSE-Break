# MSE-Break
MSE-Break is a novel soft prompt-based jailbreak method that operates by directly manipulating internal concept representations within large language models (LLMs). Rather than relying on prompt engineering or instruction rewriting, MSE-Break minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) between harmful and benign embeddings to shift internal representations and bypass refusal mechanismsâ€”without modifying model weights, logits, or access to training data.
